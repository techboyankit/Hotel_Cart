First of all I am very grateful to work on a project provided by a 
company with so much real-time practical requirements.

Owing to which, I inculcated all my learnings till now to add as
much as value as I can to the project. Though, there were some 
areas of correction required in my project, but I do assure and
promise that I will consistently upgrade so as to counter all the
pendencies. 

And once again thank you som much to everyone involved, as it was 
truly beneficial for me to get to know how to practically apply 
my software development concepts.
